                <p>We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is a fantastic little painting. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.

                  Let your heart be your guide. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. And just raise cain. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. A happy cloud. It all happens automatically.
                  
                  There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.
                  
                  Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Anyone can paint. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Let that brush dance around there and play.
                  
                  In your world you have total and absolute power. That easy. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Look at them little rascals.
                  
                  All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. In this world, everything can be happy. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.
                  
                  There he comes. Let your imagination be your guide. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Don't be bashful drop me a line.
