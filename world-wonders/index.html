        “Nature has created countless number of wonders, we got a long way to go
        as man have created only seven wonders.”
      </blockquote>

      <article>
        The fate of the original Seven Wonders has long provoked a wide spectrum
        of reactions, from melancholy meditations on human vanity to the
        transience of man's achievements.
        <aside>
          But if their most obvious lesson is that our finest creations will one
          day turn to rubble, it is a lesson that we resolutely refuse to learn.
          Which is only as it should be, as the ancient Wonders' durability—if
          only in our imagination—so eloquently testifies.

          In November 2006, the American national newspaper USA Today and the
          American television show Good Morning America revealed a list of the
          "New Seven Wonders", both natural and man-made, as chosen by six
          judges.[14] The Grand Canyon was added as an eighth wonder on November
          24, 2006, in response to viewer feedback.[15]

        <h2>Seven Natural Wonders of the World</h2>

        <p>
          Similar to the other lists of wonders, there is no consensus on a list
          of seven natural wonders of the world, and there has been debate over
          how large such a list should be. One of many existing versions of this
          list was compiled by CNN in 1997:[16]
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Aurora, in the Earth's high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and
            Antarctic)
          </li>
          <li>Grand Canyon, in Arizona, United States</li>
          <li>Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of Queensland, Australia</li>
          <li>Harbor of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</li>
          <li>Mount Everest, on the border of Nepal and China</li>
          <li>Parícutin volcano, located in the state of Michoacán, Mexico</li>

        <article>
          In 2001, an initiative was started by the Swiss corporation
          New7Wonders Foundation to choose the New 7 Wonders of the World from a
          selection of 200 existing monuments through online votes.[17] The
          Great Pyramid of Giza—part of the Giza Pyramids, the only remaining
          wonder of the traditional Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was not
          one of the winners announced in 2007 but was added as an
          <em>honorary candidate</em>.[18][19]

          A similar contemporary effort to create a list of seven natural (as
